# Backstories
------------------------------
## Hunted a Dragon
Dragons are extremely rare, even among the supernatural. You once hunted a dragon, but no one believes you.

### Suits
- STONES
- BROOKS

------------------------------

## Hunted a Phoenix
Phoenixes are among the rarest creatures on the planet - there are only a handful alive today. With their resurrection ability, they almost never stay dead. You hunted one once, but you were unable to kill it. You did manage to convince it to stop killing mortals.

### Suits
- GALES
- FLAMES

------------------------------

## Hunted a Unicorn
You once worked a case where you hunted a unicorn, the only one in existence. Perhaps you found it in your heart to spare the majestic creature. Or perhaps you are forever cursed as the person who killed it.

### Suits
- GALES
- BROOKS

------------------------------
# Talents
------------------------------
## Drank Dragon Blood
You have consumed dragon blood, and have taken on some aspect of the dragon's power. Your eyes glow a faint yellow and your skin has a scaly texture. After the effect wears off, you must wait 30 seconds before using it again.

### Mechanic
Make a Stones challenge. On success, choose one of the following. Lasts 10 seconds: Dragon Flight - You can fly. Dragon Breath - You deal 2 Strikes of damage to all enemies in Melee or Short range. Dragon Armor - You take 1 fewer Strikes of damage from physical attacks.

### Enhancement
The enhancement takes a great toll on your body. You suffer 4 Strikes of damage when the effect wears off.

### Trigger

------------------------------

## Phoenix's Blessing of Knowledge
You earned a favor from a phoenix. The blessing imparted all of the knowledge the nearly immortal creature had attained over its long life. Remembering it all at once is dangerous, so it was locked into a dark corner of your mind. Access it at your own risk.

### Mechanic
Make a Flames challenge. On success, you may ask one question to the phoenix's store of knowledge. The question may not pertain to current or future events (ie, you cannot ask "What is killing these people?" but you can ask "What could have caused these wounds?")

### Enhancement
Accessing the knowledge is dangerous. You take 5 Strikes of damage.

### Trigger
- FLAMES

------------------------------

## Silver Blood
Due to a curse (or maybe a blessing), your blood looks silver and metallic and has all the same properties as silver. This makes you a rather effective hunter, as silver is deadly to most monsters.

### Mechanic
Your fists count as silver weapons to monsters that are vulnerable to silver. You can use your blood to coat weapons and give them the properties of silver.

### Enhancement
If you cut yourself to gain access to your blood, make a Stones challenge to avoid cutting too deep. On a failure, you succeed in coating the weapon, but you cannot act for 30 seconds as you recover from the blood loss.

------------------------------

## Wyvern Familiar
You have a magical bond with a small dragon-like creature. It can fly, you can share its senses, and it will follow your orders. If it's in danger, it can breath fire in very small blasts and has sharp claws and teeth.

------------------------------
# Flaws
------------------------------
## Nobody Believes You
Whether you're lying or telling the truth, there's something about your phrasing and tone of voice that makes you really hard to believe. You've struggled with it all your life, but people still think you're always lying.

### Mechanic
Lose 1 die on all Brooks challenges.

------------------------------

## Ooo, Shiny!!
You are very easily distracted by shiny objects or the promise of treasure. You usually want to explore every inch of a crypt or cave hoping to find gold or jewels.

### Storyteller
At your discretion, have this player make a Gales challenge. On failure, the character sees something shiny and is distracted for a turn.

------------------------------

## Primordial Nightmares
You have nightmares about chaos and darkness, about creatures that ruled the world before angels and demons. You sometimes see them when you're awake. You see long, writhing shadows and hear rhythmic chanting. You're pretty sure you're slowly going insane.

### Storyteller
At your discretion, have this player make a Brooks challenge. On failure, the player is driven insane and behaves unpredictably for the remainder of the scene.

------------------------------

## Claustrophobic
You are deathly afraid of confined spaces and being trapped.

### Mechanic
You must make a Brooks challenge before entering a small space or becoming trapped. On a failure, you are too scared to enter.

------------------------------
# Signature Move
------------------------------
## Aspect of the Dragon
You can shift form and take on some aspects of a dragon.

### Mechanic
Choose 1 of the following enhancements to take on for the remainder of the scene: Dragon Flight - You can fly. Dragon Breath - You deal 3 Strikes of damage to all enemies in Melee or Short range. Dragon Armor - You take 2 fewer Strikes of damage from physical attacks.

# Inventory

## Sword of Bruncvik
Bruncvik was an adventuring knight from Prague and one of the first hunters. His sword has slain a great number of creatures of the night. It is a powerful artifact capable of killing many legendary monsters. However, it is little more than a sharp blade to lesser creatures.

### Mechanic
Deals 2 Strikes of damage to ordinary creatures. Deals 6 Strikes of damage to legendary creatures.

### Range
- MELEE

------------------------------

## EpiPen
A syringe filled with an adrenaline mixture. Just pull off the cap and stab it into a person's leg or arm. The mixture is enough to bring a person back from unconsciousness and might give them just enough of a kick to escape whatever is chasing them.

### Mechanic
Use on a character who has been removed from a scene due to their wounds. They come back for the remainder of the scene, but will succumb to their wounds and be removed from the next scene unless healed. They are removed from the current scene again if they suffer another wound.

### Range
- MELEE

------------------------------
# Plot Twists
------------------------------
## Recognized
One of the NPCs recognizes the players as wanted criminals in a previous case and is about to alert the authorities.

------------------------------

## Bystander Help
One of the normal bystanders the players met earlier has followed them and just burst onto the scene trying to help. The wannabe hero is far more likely to get themselves killed.

------------------------------
# Locations
------------------------------
## Cafe
A simple breakfast cafe. It has a decent-sized local crowd and always attracts travelers. The specials are clearly advertised and usually feature a pun or turn of phrase that's trying way too hard to be witty.

------------------------------

## Heaven
The kingdom of the angels where the souls of the good are sent after death to live happily for eternity. There are portals on Earth that can take living mortals to Heaven, but they are hard to find and under heavy guard.

------------------------------
# Theme
------------------------------
## Living Faerie Tale
Faerie tales, or maybe just one tale, are coming to life. Whether through a ritual or accident, the players must now contend with storybook villains in the real world. The biggest problem is that it’s normally difficult to kill monsters, but it’s nearly impossible to kill a story.
