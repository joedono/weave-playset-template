## Creatures of Myth
Dragons have existed since medieval times. They are a favored target of many stupid knights looking to prove their worth. They are incredibly intelligent, physically strong, and have immense magical power.

# Talents

## Magic Breath
Contrary to popular belief, Dragons do not actually breathe fire. They breathe a magical energy blast that can have many different properties. Most just favor using fire as a model.

### Mechanic
Make a Flames challenge. On success, deal 5 Strikes of damage to all creatures in range.

### Enhancement
The Dragon pours more of its energy into the blast. Deals an additional 5 Strikes of damage to all creatures in range, but the Dragon is exhausted and loses its next turn of combat.

## Flight
Of course Dragons can fly.

------------------------------

## Human Appearance
Dragons are also able to take on human form to seek out potential victims.

### Mechanic
The only way to tell a Dragon from a human is to cut them. A Dragon's blood is purple and you can see scales through the cuts in their skin.

# Flaws
------------------------------
## Legendary Resistance
Dragons can only be killed by ancient and famous weapons, such as Excalibur or the Sword of Bruncvik.

### Mechanic
If the killing blow involves an ancient legendary weapon, the Dragon dies. If not, the Dragon falls unconscious or attempts to escape.

------------------------------

## Treasure Sickness
Dragons often do not care about the affairs of "lesser creatures" such as mortals, but they love treasure and precious metal.

### Mechanic
Dragons are very open to bribery with precious metals.
